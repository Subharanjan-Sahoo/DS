--> Non-Linear Data Structure
--> Represents relationship between Nodes.
--> Collection of entites call Nodes.
--> Nodes are connected by edges.
    
Characteristics of Tree
------------------------
1.Root Node
    * The top most Node.
    * A Tree can contain only one root Node.
2.In Tree if we have N Nodes then will have N-1 edges/link
   eg: 11 Node
       (11-1)=10 no edges.
3.Every child will have only one parent But parent can have multiple child.
4.Tree is a recursive Structure

Degree of a Node:
------------------- 
It is number of child in that Node

Degree of Tree:
-----------------
The highest degree of a node in the tree is called Tree.

Level:
------
The height of the tree is call is Level.

height of node:
-----------------
The longest path node to leaf.

height of a tree:
----------------
height of root node

Depth:
-------
find the path and calculate the number of edges.



Binary Tree:
-------------
If node contain 2 child not more than the 2 child thn it is called the Binary tree.


TYPES:
-------
1) Full Binary Tree

2) Complete Binary Tree

3) derfect Binary Tree

4) Balanced Binary Tree

5) Pathological Binary Tree



Full Binary Child:
-------------------
It is a Binary tree in which Every node other then leaf node has two children.(No one Node)


Complete Binary Tree:
-----------------------
-> all Level except last Level
                   -> Completely filled

-> last Level -> Complete filled 
                       -> Leaf to Right
